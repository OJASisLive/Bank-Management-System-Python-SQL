# LATEST NOTICE:
See [this pull request](https://github.com/OJASisLive/Bank-Management-System-Python-SQL/pull/6) for details about merger of ["shorten-the-code"](https://github.com/OJASisLive/Bank-Management-System-Python-SQL/tree/shorten-the-code) branch into the main branch.

# OLD NOTICE:
Further updates would be pushed on the ["shorten-the-code"](https://github.com/OJASisLive/Bank-Management-System-Python-SQL/tree/shorten-the-code) branch where I am planning to shorten the code by
removing duplicate code and referencing them.

- I will test the code from the surface and "won't test till depth" (atleast till the project is over).
- I will "hard-test" the code when the project is complete.

# Bank Management System:
First of all, whole code is written by me and nothing has been copy pasted fron anywhere.

The project has Dependencies which are all open sourced (modules such as pickle, csv, mysql-connector)

# Requirements:
1. Python 3
2. MySQL workbench 8.0

because I've tested the code using these versions only...

# Setup:
Run the file named "main.py" and follow the instructions of the program...

# How to reset:
Open the file named "firsttime.txt" and change the value from False to True (case sensitive)

# Troubleshooting:
1.I suspect that the people who haven't set a password for SQL may encounter an error. (will fix it later)

I strongly suggest users to have a password set in MySQL.

2.Check if the terminal shows the message "Connection established successfully"

That means you entered your credentials properly

3.Any other exception will pop up in the terminal...
